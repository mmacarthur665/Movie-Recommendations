# Movie-Recommendations
This project takes locally saved data about movies/movie ratings, and will generate recommendations. 

This is a school project which I have posted here to show some of the Python skills I have learned. This program includes the use of numpy, pandas, and os packages.

This program will require that you download the "data" files and save them in the working directory for where you run code. The files contain general information on movies (IMDB.csv),
critic's ratings of movies (ratings.csv), and the ratings of several different people (p2.csv - p10.csv). 

The first thing the program will ask for is where the data is saved and which files you want to use. An example of input that will work is:
data IMDB.csv ratings.csv p2.csv
